# 🌍 Travel Agency Page  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This is my project, part of **FreeCodeCamp lab**, where we practice HTML fundamentals by creating a travel agency webpage.  
It includes elements such as **unordered lists (`<ul>`), images (`<img>`), figure elements (`<figure>`), figcaptions (`<figcaption>`), anchor links (`<a>`), and more.**  

## ✨ Features  
- **Structured travel packages** with `<ul>` elements for clarity.  
- **Top itineraries** section featuring images and descriptive `<figcaption>` elements.  
- **Semantic HTML tags** ensuring accessibility and organization.  
- **Footer with credits and project information.**  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
✅ **HTML5** (no CSS or JavaScript, keeping the project simple for HTML learning).
